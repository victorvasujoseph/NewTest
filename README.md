Overview:

The goal of this project is to analyze and conclude “Will a customer accept the coupon?”. We will be using visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

Data:

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).
