# Overview:

The goal of this project is to analyze and conclude “Will a customer accept the coupon?”. We will be using visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

# Data:

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

# Approach

### Step 1 : Data Loading and Cleaning
### Step 2 : Data Conversion
### Step 3 : Defining Groups
### Step 4 : Analyzing Characteristics
### Step 5 : Visualizing Insights


# Conclusion:

## Social and Outgoing Drivers - Frequency of Bar Visits:
Drivers who frequently visit bars (more than once a month) are more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that these drivers have a social and outgoing lifestyle that includes regular visits to bars.

## Younger Demographic - Age Factor:
Drivers under the age of 30 tend to accept bar coupons more often than older drivers. This implies that younger individuals are more receptive to promotional offers related to social activities like going to bars.

## High Acceptance Among Frequent Bar Visitors:

Drivers who go to bars more than once a month have a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons. This supports the hypothesis that regular bar-goers are more inclined to take advantage of such promotions.

## Young and Active Lifestyle:

A higher acceptance rate among drivers under 30 indicates that younger drivers with an active social life are more likely to use bar coupons.
Social Engagement:

The acceptance rate is higher among drivers who have adult passengers and are not widowed, suggesting that these drivers participate in social activities with peers and are more likely to accept bar coupons for social outings.

## Budget-Conscious Behavior:

Drivers with lower incomes who frequent cheap restaurants also show a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons, indicating that cost-effective social options are appealing to them.

# Conclusion
Based on these observations, we can hypothesize that drivers who accepted bar coupons are generally younger, socially active, and budget-conscious individuals who frequently visit bars and engage in social activities with adults. These drivers are likely to be receptive to promotional offers that enhance their social experiences in an affordable manner.
