Overview:

The goal of this project is to analyze and conclude “Will a customer accept the coupon?”. We will be using visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

Data:

This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

Business Understanding:

Goal: Will a customer accept the coupon?
Success Criteria: Conclude if the customer accept the coupon based on the CRISP-DM

Data Understanding:

Collect customer data: demographics, purchase history, customer service interactions, etc.
Perform EDA: Summary statistics, visualize distributions, correlation analysis.

Data Preparation:

Select features relevant to customer behavior and interaction.

Clean data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, address outliers.
Feature engineering: Create new features such as customer tenure, average purchase value.
Normalize/standardize features as needed.


Modeling:

Choose models: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests.
Split data into training and test sets.
Train models and tune hyperparameters.
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

Evaluation:

Compare model performance against business objectives.
Validate model assumptions and ensure robustness.
Interpret model outputs and ensure they align with business insights.

Deployment:

Integrate the churn prediction model into the CRM system.
Set up monitoring for model performance.
Develop a plan for regular updates and retraining of the model.
Report findings and implementation plan to stakeholders.
